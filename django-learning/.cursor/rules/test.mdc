To better follow the conventions of the repo, please adopt the following style:

- Do **NOT** use string literals
- If a comparison needs to be made a string value, make sure there's a constant for it in the appropriate constant file
- Prefer early returns whenever possible, instead of nested if or if/else ladders
- When errors are thrown, make sure you add a constant for the string in the correct constants file
