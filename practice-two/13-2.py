# Go to Project Gutenberg (http://gutenberg.org) and download

# Then modify the program to count the total number of words
# in the book, and the number of times each word is used.

# Print the number of different words used in the book. Compare 
# different books by different authors, written in different
# eras. Which author uses the most extensive vocabulary?
